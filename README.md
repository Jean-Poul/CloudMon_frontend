## Guide for using this code
1. Clone the repo to a folder of your choosing
2. Open your favorite terminal
3. Type: "npm install"
4. Type: "npm run build"
5. Type: "code ." to show code in visual studiocode
6. Locate the settings.js file and change the URL if you desire to run the project locally. Otherwise move on to step 7.
7. Type: "npm start"
8. (Optional) You can deploy your project either on your virtual machine or thru surge. I've chosen surge since it will reduce the trafic to my virtual machine for this assignment. Start by installing surge with the following command in bash "npm install --global surge". Now you can deploy your project on surge with the command "surge --project ./build --domain A_DOMAIN_NAME.surge.sh".
